This, the newarch branch of hpctoolkit-devtools, contains newer
versions of autotools.  These are the versions to use with the newarch
branches of hpctoolkit and externals.

At some point, all three branches will be merged back to their master
branches.  But until then, use this branch for the newarch branches
and the older autotools for everything else.
