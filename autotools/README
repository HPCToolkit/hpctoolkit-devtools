Autotools Build Notes
----------------------

This directory is a mini-externals package for building and installing
the autotools packages: autoconf, automake, libtool and optionally m4.
The directory it builds is suitable for an hpctoolkit /projects/pkgs
directory for autoreconf.

This package serves two purposes: (1) it makes it easy to install
autotools on a new machine for hpctoolkit, and (2) it makes it easy to
keep a consistent version of autotools across machines.  Running
autoreconf with a different version of autotools produces tons of
irrelevent diffs.  So, it is useful to keep a consistent version
across machines.

To install autotools, run './make.sh' with the install directory as
argument.  For example:

  ./make.sh  /projects/pkgs/autotools

Autotools depends on m4, version about 1.4.10 or 1.4.12 or later.  If
your system version is older, or if make.sh fails, then rerun make.sh
with '-m4'.

Current versions:

  autoconf  2.69
  automake  1.15
  libtool   2.4.6
  m4        1.4.17

To build each package manually, use:

  ./configure  --prefix=...
  make
  make install

Build in order: m4, autoconf, automake and libtool.  Add prefix/bin to
PATH after each package.
